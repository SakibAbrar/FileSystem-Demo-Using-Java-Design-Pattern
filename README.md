# FileSystem-Demo-Using-Java-Design-Pattern
Here we're just implementing a demo file system using java composite entity design pattern. 
Feel free to use.
In a hierarchical file system, there are different drives, folders and files. 
A drive can contain both folders and files. Under a folder, there can be folders and files. 
Any folder or directory can also be empty.
A user can create any folder and add the required folders and files under the folder. 
Similarly, a drive can be created and the required folders and files can be added under the drive. 
Any object can be removed by the user.
